excerpt: "Why I'm moving my canonical content to a platform I own — and what that means for readers."

If you've been following my writing on [Medium](https://the.oldschool.engineer), you already know I care about owning the stack. This site is the next step in that philosophy.

## Why Self-Host Content?

Medium is a great distribution platform, but it comes with trade-offs readers shouldn't have to deal with — accounts, cookies, and algorithmic gatekeeping. Every technical article I publish will now live here first, free and open, at a URL I control.

Medium remains a distribution channel. But **oldschool-engineer.dev** is the canonical source.

## What to Expect

The same kind of content I've always written — deep-dive engineering posts, build logs, post-mortems, and the occasional side project write-up. If you want to follow along, subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml).
