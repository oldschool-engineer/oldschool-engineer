**Senior Engineering Technical Leader** with 25+ years building and securing enterprise systems at **Amazon/AWS** and **Microsoft**, plus 10 years of **U.S. Navy** Signals Intelligence experience.

I architect systems that span the entire stack—from network infrastructure and authentication to deployment pipelines and production observability.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Market Data Platform

My pinned repositories showcase a **distributed real-time market data system** I built from scratch after leaving Amazon—a production-grade platform processing 1,000+ events/second:

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [kuhl-haus-mdp](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp) | Core market data processing library |
| [kuhl-haus-mdp-servers](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp-servers) | Backend microservices |
| [kuhl-haus-mdp-app](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp-app) | Frontend & service control plane |
| [kuhl-haus-mdp-deployment](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp-deployment) | Kubernetes & Ansible automation |

**Tech stack:** Kubernetes • Redis • RabbitMQ • FastAPI • py4web • OAuth 2.0 • OpenTelemetry

## 🏠 Kuhl Haus Organization

[Kuhl Haus](https://github.com/kuhl-haus) is my open-source organization dedicated to transforming practical home automation and infrastructure projects into community tools. What started as building a robust home lab has evolved into a collection of MIT-licensed packages available on GitHub.

**Philosophy:** Ship production-quality code with comprehensive tests, documentation, and real-world application examples. Every project includes CI/CD pipelines, code coverage, and security scanning.

**Active Projects:** Stock market data processing platform (Kuhl Haus MDP) and a site monitoring service named "Magpie".

## 📝 Technical Writing

I document my engineering journey at [the.oldschool.engineer](https://the.oldschool.engineer):

- [What I Built After Quitting Amazon](https://the.oldschool.engineer/28fc3b6d9be0?sk=37671a98e71059e0c635c4f15c56f5ff) — 5-part series on building production-grade distributed systems

## 💡 What Drives Me

I believe in **intentional simplicity**—building systems that solve real problems without over-engineering. Check out [this post-mortem](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp/issues/3) for an example of how I approach debugging and quality.
