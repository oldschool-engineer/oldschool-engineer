**Senior Engineering Technical Leader** with 25+ years building and securing enterprise systems at **Amazon/AWS** and **Microsoft**, plus 10 years of **U.S. Navy** Signals Intelligence experience.

I architect systems that span the entire stack—from network infrastructure and authentication to deployment pipelines and production observability.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Market Data Platform

My pinned repositories showcase a **distributed real-time market data system** I built from scratch after leaving Amazon—a production-grade platform processing 1,000+ events/second:

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [kuhl-haus-mdp](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp) | Core market data processing library |
| [kuhl-haus-mdp-servers](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp-servers) | Backend microservices |
| [kuhl-haus-mdp-app](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp-app) | Frontend & service control plane |
| [kuhl-haus-mdp-deployment](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp-deployment) | Kubernetes & Ansible automation |

**Tech stack:** Kubernetes • Redis • RabbitMQ • FastAPI • py4web • OAuth 2.0 • OpenTelemetry

## 🏠 Kuhl Haus Organization

[Kuhl Haus](https://github.com/kuhl-haus) is my open-source organization dedicated to transforming practical home automation and infrastructure projects into community tools. What started as building a robust home lab has evolved into a collection of MIT-licensed packages available on GitHub.

**Philosophy:** Ship production-quality code with comprehensive tests, documentation, and real-world application examples. Every project includes CI/CD pipelines, code coverage, and security scanning.

**Active Projects:** Stock market data processing platform (Kuhl Haus MDP) and a site monitoring service named "Magpie".

## 😄 Side Project: Random Dad Jokes

Sometimes the best way to learn is to build something fun. [ur.janky.click](https://ur.janky.click/) is a single-page dad joke app I built in an hour—100% HTML, GitHub Pages hosting, custom domain, API integration, and zero JavaScript frameworks. It's a practical demonstration of how far you can go with intentional simplicity. Read about the [build process and technical choices](https://blog.cubed.run/automating-laughter-building-a-random-dad-joke-site-in-an-hour-dc35e0627674) that made it possible.

## 📝 Technical Writing

I document my engineering journey at [the.oldschool.engineer](https://the.oldschool.engineer):

- [What I Built After Quitting Amazon](https://the.oldschool.engineer/what-i-built-after-quitting-amazon-spoiler-its-a-stock-scanner-28fc3b6d9be0) — 5-part series on building production-grade distributed systems

## 💡 What Drives Me

I believe in **intentional simplicity**—building systems that solve real problems without
over-engineering. Check out [this post-mortem](https://github.com/kuhl-haus/kuhl-haus-mdp/issues/3)
for an example of how I approach debugging and quality.

## 🤔 Why "oldschool-engineer"?

**oldschool-engineer** wasn't a name I picked — it was given to me. I was leading an
engineering team in AWS EC2 when my team discovered I run what is, by any honest measure,
a home data center — a 13-node Proxmox cluster in a 42U rack, triple-redundant Internet,
and my own on-prem cloud. I gave a tech talk about it. When I got to the part about
building my own certified 10Gbps ethernet cables from raw spools of CAT6A — measured, cut,
terminated, tested, and dressed to spec — one of my engineers just stopped me:

> *"Whoa. You're like a real, serious, 'old school' engineer. You were building Internet
> services before the cloud existed."*

The DNS domains were available. Done.

Damn right. I'm the Oldschool Engineer.

*Yes, "oldschool-engineer," "old school," and "Oldschool" are all used differently here.
Merriam-Webster says it should be "old-school," but I'm a DNS nerd, not an English teacher.
In a domain name, a hyphen or period naturally replaces a space — so "oldschool engineer" becomes
`oldschool-engineer.dev` or `oldschool.engineer` and that's perfectly clean. But follow Merriam-Webster's
hyphenation and you get `old-school-engineer.dev` or `old-school.engineer` — and
nobody wants to live with that. So "oldschool" it is. Roll with it.*
